This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

# WebDevFwProject

A fictional book e‑commerce web application built with Angular, featuring product listing, search/filtering, cart management, and a simple checkout flow. The project scaffolding and development workflow use Angular CLI (v17.3.4).

## Features

- Browse and search a catalog of fictional books with category and keyword filtering.
- View product details with pricing, and metadata.
- Add/remove items to the cart and adjust quantities.
- Persist cart state during navigation.


## Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS and npm installed
- Angular CLI globally installed: `npm install -g @angular/cli`


## Development server

Run `npm install` once, then `ng serve` to start a dev server at `http://localhost:4200/`. The app auto‑reloads on source changes.

## Code scaffolding

Generate building blocks with Angular CLI:

- Component: `ng generate component component-name`
- Directive/Pipe/Service/Class/Guard/Interface/Enum/Module: `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`


## Build

- Development build: `ng build` (outputs to `dist/`).
- Production build: `ng build --configuration production` for optimized bundles (AOT, budgets, minification).
- Analyze bundle: `ng build --configuration production --stats-json` then inspect with preferred analyzer.

## Further help

Use `ng help` or visit the Angular CLI documentation page for command reference and best practices.

## Roadmap (optional)

- Authentication and user accounts
- Order history and wishlists
